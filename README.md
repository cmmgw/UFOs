# Summary
There are a couple of drawbacks to the webpage and possible recommendations are suggested for further development of the webpage. 

* **Drawbacks:**
* It is great that one can filter through the data, however, it would be helpful if the search filter boxes can include a dropdown so that users can easily select the data contained within those fields. 

* **Recommendations:**
* It would also be helpful if searches can be filtered by the duration of the UFO sighting by grouping the time entries in bins; i.e. 0 – 30 seconds, 30 seconds – 1 minute, 1 minute – 2 minutes, 2 minutes – 5 minutes, 5 minutes+
* Although the dataset contains a snapshot of UFO sightings in 2010, it would be helpful to have a functionality to capture real time data, so that the dataset can be more comprehensive.
